Then, the probability of observing an interaction between two nucleons located in the overlap region is defined as the product of the nuclear overlap function and the total in- elastic cross section between two nucleons Ïƒinel. As already introduced, each nucleon does not deflect its trajectory after the interaction with another nucleons. As a consequence each nucleon can participate in more than one binary collision and the probability of having n binary collisions between the nuclei A and B, having A and B nucleons respectively, can be computed using the binomial statistics:
